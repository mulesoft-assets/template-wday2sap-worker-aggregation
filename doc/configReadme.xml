As a SAP admin I want to aggregate workers from Workday and employees from SAP and compare them to see which workers can only be found in one of the two and which workers are in both instances. 

For practical purposes this Template will generate the result in the format of a CSV Report sent by mail.

This Template should serve as a foundation for extracting data from two systems, aggregating data, comparing values of fields for the objects, and generating a report on the differences. 

As implemented, it gets workers from Workday and employees from SAP, compares by the email address of the workers and employees, and generates a CSV file which shows workers in Workday, employees in SAP. The report is then emailed to a configured group of email addresses.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**
Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.
## Disclaimer
This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies in oder to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, please continue reading.
You will find that there are three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id: 
	**com.sap.conn.jco** 
These dependencies are private for Mulesoft and will cause you application not to build from a Maven command line. You need to replace them with "provided" scope and copy the libraries into the build path.

The Workday connector currently does not support autopaging functionality out of the box so number of processed objects are limited to the connector's single page size.

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `workdayworkersaggregation` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://workdayworkersaggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and the report will be sent to the emails configured.

Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case and an [SMTP Transport](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SMTP+Transport+Reference) as the outbound way to send the report.

$H$H# Trigger Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

$H$H# Outbound Flow
**SMTP Outbound Endpoint** - Send Mail
+ Both SMTP Server configuration and the actual mail to be sent are defined in this endpoint.
+ This flow is going to be invoked from the flow that does all the functional work: *mainFlow*, the same that is invoked from the Inbound Flow upon triggering of the HTTP Endpoint.

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records and finally formating the output, in this case being a report.
The *mainFlow* organises the job in three different steps and finally invokes the *outboundFlow* that will deliver the report to the corresponding outbound endpoint.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.

$H$H# Gather Data Flow
[Java Transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Java+Transformer+Reference) responsible for aggregating the results from SAP (employees) and Workday (workers).
Criteria and format applied:

+ Transformer calls two subflows where data are loaded from both Workday and SAP and aggregated to the List of Maps with keys: **Name**, **Email**, **IDInWorkday**, **WorkerNameInWorkday**, **IDInSalesforce** and 
**UserNameInSalesforce**.
+ Workers and Employees will be matched by email, that is to say, a record in Workday and SAP organisations with same email is considered the same worker (employee).

$H$H# sapRetrievalMapperFlow
Employees are loaded by [SAP connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector) to List of Maps with keys: **FirstName**, **LastName**, **Email**, **Id** and **Username**

$H$H# workdayRetrievalMapperFlow
Workers are loaded by [Workday connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Workday+Connector) to List of Maps with keys: **Name**, **Email**, **Id** and **Username**

$H$H# Format Output Flow
[Java Transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Java+Transformer+Reference) responsible for sorting the list of users in the following order:

1. Workers only in Workday
2. Employees only in SAP
3. Workers and Employees in both Workday and SAP

All records ordered alphabetically by mail within each category.
If you want to change this order then the *compare* method should be modified.

+ CSV Report [DataMapper](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Datamapper+User+Guide+and+Reference) transforming the List of Maps in CSV with headers **Name**, **Email**, **IDInWorkday**, **WorkerNameInWorkday**, **IDInSalesforce** and **UserNameInSalesforce**.
+ An [Object to string transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Transformers) is used to set the payload as an String.
